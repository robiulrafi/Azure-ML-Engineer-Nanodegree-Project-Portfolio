# Project Deliverables Summary

1. [Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure](https://github.com/robiulrafi/Azure-ML-Engineer-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Optimizing%20an%20ML%20Pipeline%20in%20Azure)

In the Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure project, an ML pipeline is being created and optimized. A custom-coded model—a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression—is provided, with its hyperparameters being optimized using HyperDrive. Additionally, AutoML is being used to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, allowing for a comparison of the results of the two methods.
