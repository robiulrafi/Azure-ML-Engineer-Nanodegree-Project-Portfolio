This repository here encompasses projects from the **MS-AZURE MACHINE LEARNING NANODEGREE PROGRAM** offered by UDACITY. 


# Summary of Project Deliverables

[**Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure**](https://github.com/robiulrafi/Azure-ML-Engineer-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Optimizing%20an%20ML%20Pipeline%20in%20Azure)

- Completion of an ML pipeline creation and optimization task.
 Utilization of a custom-coded model—a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression—where the hyperparameters are optimized using HyperDrive.
-. Application of AutoML to construct and refine a model on the same dataset, enabling a comparative analysis of results from both methodologies.

The architecture diagram as demonstrated below provides a visual representation of the logical process flow of this project. credited to Udacity's **MLEMA Nanodegree**.

[**MLOps: Orchestrating Machine Learning Operations**](https://github.com/robiulrafi/Azure-ML-Engineer-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/MLOps%3A%20Orchestrating%20Machine%20Learning%20Operations)

- The [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) is utilized in this project.-
-  Azure is employed to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it.
- A pipeline is created, published, and consumed throughout the project.
- At the conclusion, all work is demonstrated by creating a README file and a screencast video.

[**Capstone Project: Predicting Patient Survival in Heart Failure with Azure Machine Learning**](https://github.com/robiulrafi/Azure-ML-Engineer-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Capstone%20Project%3A%20Predicting%20Patient%20Survival%20in%20Heart%20Failure%20with%20Azure%20Machine%20Learning)

- This project provides the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired from the Nanodegree to solve an interesting problem.
- Two models are created: one using Automated ML (AutoML) and one customized model with tuned hyperparameters using HyperDrive.
- The performance of both models is compared, and the best performing model is deployed.
- The project demonstrates the ability to utilize an external dataset in the workspace, train models using various tools within the AzureML framework, and deploy the model as a web service.
