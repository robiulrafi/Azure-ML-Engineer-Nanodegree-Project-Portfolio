# Summary of Project Deliverables

[**Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure**](https://github.com/robiulrafi/Azure-ML-Engineer-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Optimizing%20an%20ML%20Pipeline%20in%20Azure)

1. Completion of an ML pipeline creation and optimization task.
2. Utilization of a custom-coded model—a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression—where the hyperparameters are optimized using HyperDrive.
3. Application of AutoML to construct and refine a model on the same dataset, enabling a comparative analysis of results from both methodologies.
