This repository here encompasses projects from the **MS-AZURE MACHINE LEARNING NANODEGREE PROGRAM** offered by UDACITY. 


**Project Deliverables Summary**

In the Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure project, an ML pipeline is being created and optimized. A custom-coded model—a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression—is provided, with its hyperparameters being optimized using HyperDrive. Additionally, AutoML is being used to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, allowing for a comparison of the results of the two methods.
